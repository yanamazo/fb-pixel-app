# fb-pixel-app

This is a marketer-friendly FB Pixel App:
- based on the official Python SDK -- this SDK normalizes and hashes all data automatically, that's much more convinient than preparing data by yourself for FB Graph API.
- google cloud function ready -- just deploy this code as a function and use it for your projects at net cost https://console.cloud.google.com/functions

If I could be of any assistance for you to adjust this code for your needs, just mention me in twitter @mazault
